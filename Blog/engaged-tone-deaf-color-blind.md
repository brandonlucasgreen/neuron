<p>I proposed to Alicia over the weekend. It took almost a year, but I finally did it. I had a <a href="http://sophiehughes.com">custom engagement ring</a> made and I took her out to a <a href="http://troquetboston.com">beautiful dinner overlooking Boston Common</a> and I walked her around the <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/parks/emerald/Public_Garden.asp">Public Garden</a> and then we celebrated at the <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/boston-parker-house">Omni Parker House</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Simple, but classic us.</p><p>The amount of anxiety that you get when trying to pull off a proposal is staggering. It’s not even necessarily the <em>hardest</em> decision of your life — since we’re madly in love with each other and it was a no-brainer — but it’s still a massive commitment that relies on a level of faith &amp; confidence in both the relationship and oneself. I had wanted to say something ultra-romantic and profound before getting down on my knee…but I totally choked under my own anxiety. I ended up just kissing her repeatedly to hide my sweating and buy myself time to figure out something to say.</p><p><strong>Which is when I reminded myself, again:</strong> if you really love someone (or something, for that matter), why the anxiety at all? Drop the anxiety. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0">Just do it</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>So I did! And now we can call each other our fiancés.</p><p>Oh, here are some pictures of us being cute and engaged and stuff.</p>
