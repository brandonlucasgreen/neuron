<p>I haven’t written a “favorite albums” list in a few years, mostly because I realized that mine were virtually identical to most of those my friends would write up. That’s one of the unfortunate downsides of having friends in the music industry: if a band gets enough hype to be in a Top 10 list, everyone’s talking about that band.</p><p>2015 was one of the first years in a while, though, in which a lot of the buzzed-about music was downright <strong>ambitious</strong>: while there was plenty of crap for the masses to party/drone to, there were also plenty of musicians who stopped giving a fuck about playing nice and made cool, interesting, challenging music. Cases in point: Kendrick Lamar, Bjork’s Vulnicura, “Hotline Bling” and Titus Andronicus’ 90-minute manic depression rock opera, just to start.</p><p>I felt inspired by all this and had one of the more prolific years of writing music I’ve ever had. Some of the music I found most challenging and inspiring, though, was reviled, dismissed, or missed entirely by mainstream music journalism. I’d like to spend some time reflecting on the hidden genius of <strong>those</strong> songs and albums.*&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s start with a doozy: <em>Miley Cyrus and her Dead Petz</em>, released via SoundCloud &amp; VMA surprise in August.</p><a class="image-link image2 " target="_blank" href="blob:https://tonedeafcolorblind.substack.com/c925af6d-812d-4b15-91e6-51b8f1ff64d0"><img src="blob:https://tonedeafcolorblind.substack.com/c925af6d-812d-4b15-91e6-51b8f1ff64d0" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;blob:https://tonedeafcolorblind.substack.com/c925af6d-812d-4b15-91e6-51b8f1ff64d0&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:null,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a><p>I don’t dance much, but two songs this year made me start dancing more than any other: “King Kunta,” for obvious reasons, and Miley Cyrus’ “Slab of Butter (Scorpion).”&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t ask me why. I can’t explain it. But that damn bouncy synth texture paired with a fuzz bass made for my downtempo jam of 2015, and I’m not mad about it. I’m only mad when it ends, and then after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW5M4QuxnKc">45 seconds of Miley talking about how drunk she is</a>, the beat comes back in the form of a fun diss track called “I Forgive Yiew” (sic, but who cares? Miley sure doesn’t). The slow bounce continues for another 3 minutes, and it’s kind of glorious.</p><p>The next song, “I Get So Scared,” haunted the shit out of me when I first heard it. It still does, which is a weird thing to digest given that this is BASICALLY HANNAH MONTANA telling me that “they say love grows / but I’ve only seen it die.” After that happens, I find mellow euphoria in “Lighter,” a highly underrated 80s throwback.&nbsp;</p><p>People HATED this album. I don’t. It’s weird and sprawling and usually inappropriate, but every time I come back to it, I find another nugget of something charming, dark or downright beautiful. “I Get So Scared” is one of those nuggets.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, it starts with the silly “Dooo It!”, but immediately after you get 2 solid ballads in “Karen Don’t Be Sad” and “The Floyd Song.” For every stupid track on this album, you get multiple gems. Sure, “Milky Milky Milk” is probably a song about lactating, but it has one of the coolest beats of the year. Sure, Miley cries when singing about Pablow her dead blowfish, but you can’t fault her for expressing some real emotion in a song. The 6-song run of “Cyrus Skies” to “Lighter” is pretty fantastic, and could make for an excellent psych-pop EP in itself.</p><p>I do think Miley brought some of the bad rap and <a href="http://www.spin.com/2015/09/review-miley-cyrus-fakes-her-own-career-suicide-on-miley-cyrus-and-her-dead-petz/">flat-out dismissal</a> upon herself - the “complete, full-metal DGAF” approach to album structure and focus, plus the fact that she made this album outside of her recording contract, lends the album to be taken both <em>less</em> seriously and <em>more</em> like it’s trying be taken seriously. Most of the negative or apathetic critical reaction has been based on the assumption that this album <em>should</em> be interpreted as higher-concept than it probably should be. And to those critics, it disappoints as a high-concept pet project.</p><p>But why should we treat <em>Dead Petz</em> as anything beyond what it is at face value? It’s a long, sprawling collection of songs covering several topics, some of which are very silly. Nobody gave Prince any flack about that when <em>1999</em> came out and contained a <a href="http://genius.com/Prince-delirious-lyrics">song about vinegar strokes</a> and <a href="http://prince.org/msg/7/284088">another one with 2 uncomfortable minutes of orgasm sounds</a>. Why should Miley Cyrus be dismissed for calling a song “Bang Me Box” when <a href="http://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-anaconda-lyrics">Nicki Minaj can release a song glorifying her own ass</a>, or <a href="http://genius.com/Fetty-wap-trap-queen-lyrics">a song about a girl who makes crack cocaine</a> became one of the top hits of the year? (Oh and remember when a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped_Up_Kicks#Composition_and_inspiration">song about shooting up a school</a> became a pop hit? Great job, music industry.) <em>Dead Petz</em> doesn’t need to be anything more than it is, and critics shouldn’t dismiss it because it doesn’t reach their impossibly high standards of long, ambitious works that break political or spiritual ground. <strong>It’s as if critics are no longer willing to let their subjects just unwind and not be taken too seriously.</strong></p><p>If anything, this album disappoints me because it makes me wonder how it would have been accepted if a few throwaway tracks were removed and it was a <em>bit</em> more polished. If “Fuckin’ Fucked Up” (which should not be treated as anything more than an interlude) was removed from the track listing and was attached to “BB Talk” as a prelude, would people use it as an excuse to dismiss the album? “Something About Space Dude” is effectively a coda to “The Floyd Song” - what if Miley positioned these two separate tracks as a single 8-minute space rock epic, like what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoveStoned#Critical_response">JT did with some of his solo material</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>For those who want to give this album a second chance but can’t deal with the full 23 tracks, I propose a revised <em>Dead Petz</em> track listing, which is <em>only</em> an hour long:</p><blockquote><p>1.	Dooo It! <em>&lt;— only because nothing else really works as an opener</em></p><p>2.	Karen, Don’t Be Sad</p><p>3.	The Floyd Song (Sunrise) <em>w/ optional coda: Something About Space Dude</em></p><p>4.	Space Boots</p><p>5.	BB Talk</p><p>6.	Milky Milky Milk</p><p>7.	Cyrus Skies</p><p>8.	Slab of Butter (Scorpion) <em>w/ optional coda: I’m So Drunk</em></p><p>9.	Lighter</p><p>10.	I Get So Scared</p><p>11.	I Forgive Yiew</p><p>12.	1 Sun</p><p>13.	Pablow The Blowfish</p><p>14.	Miley Tibetan Bowlzzz <em>(bonus track)</em></p></blockquote><p>It’s really hard to take Miley Cyrus seriously, and that’s okay. Bizarrely enough, the thing that convinced me to have respect for her is the album in which she takes herself the least seriously. You should give this album a chance if you didn’t yet this year.</p><p>—-</p><p>Oh, and lastly, I put out an EP too, but it’s probably not on anyone’s best-of lists because I barely promoted it. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sphmrs/sets/of-our-lives-ep">Check it out</a>, though! It’s fun.</p>
