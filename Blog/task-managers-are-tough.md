<p>Wunderlist, Trello, Todoist, OmniFocus. 2do. Things. I have to imagine that most smartphone users haven’t even heard of these apps. That's probably why there's such an apparent subculture around each one. The average person will never break into the most beloved apps, and those who do will defend it to no end.&nbsp;</p><p>So why don’t so many people, who presumably have things they need to do in their lives, use one of these tools? For all the people that <em>do</em> try a project management tool, why do so many underutilize them?</p><p>Everyone has a smartphone, and most of them probably use stock functionality (read: Reminders &amp; Calendar) to keep track of their daily lives on that smartphone. However, <strong>Reminders rarely has accountability</strong> - what if you forget to set a reminder time? What if you miss the location-specific notification by the time you’ve left? What if some to-dos are dependent on others and you can’t check them off the list until some other thing you neglected gets done?&nbsp;</p><p>Are the to-dos I’m getting reminded about even a good use of my time right now?&nbsp;</p><p>What about the big important complicated things I want to do?&nbsp;</p><p>How do I even break those things down into the little to-dos to put in my list?&nbsp;</p><p>What does that mean to me in the big picture?</p><p>The average person doesn’t want to (and almost certainly can’t) think through all that stuff, even though they potentially have implications on their daily lives.</p><p>This conundrum, in the workplace, is basically why project and product managers exist. Product managers help to figure out the right things to focus on and why; project managers make sure they happen so you, Mr. Stakeholder Guy don’t have to worry about all the little details.</p><p>Personal assistant apps exist, <a href="http://appcrawlr.com/ios-apps/best-apps-virtual-assistant">even virtual ones</a>, to remind you of upcoming meetings and tasks - so why haven’t we developed a “personal product manager” that takes your big goals in life and helps you break them down and focus on the most achievable pieces of said goal?&nbsp;</p><p>I think about the big things that I want to eventually do in my life - get married, build a company, buy a house, be a notable musician, other things - there’s a <strong>ton of knowledge</strong> of what to do to make those things happen on the Internet. But parsing all that information is a nightmare - you’re basically relegated to Google searching or starting with blogs/resources you trust and vetting the content endlessly until you end up with a series of tasks, which may or may not be in order, prioritized or even possible. Then, you have friends and/or family as a resource, which may contradict your online findings (or even each other). I don’t even want to think about the difference between my dad’s opinion on starting a business compared to my previous employer.</p><p>Productivity apps can’t do this thinking; it’s not what they’re designed to do. 2do, one of my favorites, requires a whole lot of task creation and organization in order to be truly useful. and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5989980/ive-been-using-evernote-all-wrong-heres-why-its-actually-amazing?utm_expid=66866090-62.H_y_0o51QhmMY_tue7bevQ.0&amp;utm_referrer=http://lifehacker.com/5989980/ive-been-using-evernote-all-wrong-heres-why-its-actually-amazing">People have said that about Evernote</a>, too. Trello is great for visualizing projects in a board format, but it doesn't tell you what should populate that board and what of that stuff needs to get done in order to make BIG AMAZING GOAL X happen. (That's probably why they've started collecting and sharing <a href="https://trello.com/inspiration">sample boards for various use cases</a>.) The thought process around focusing the idea into discrete pieces hasn't been productized for personal lives.&nbsp;</p><p>I wonder if this is why productivity apps aren't ubiquitous - because they exist to humor the details of lives instead of boiling them down to what’s important.</p>
