# It's not obsessive-compulsive
<p>Every day when I get home from work, I walk in the door, kiss my girlfriend Alicia and start organizing things. If it's Monday, I take the trash and recycling out to the street and line up all our bins neatly in a row. Otherwise I put my keys on the hook, my wallet &amp; sunglasses in a tray next to said hook, pick up the small pile of bags, jackets and/or shoes that Alicia leaves by the door and put each item in its respective closet or corner; then as she starts cooking I tidy up the non-junk mail we received that day, throw the rest into recycling, wash my coffee mug out in the sink, wash her mug out, review the state of the dishwasher. Next I'm washing dishes as she uses them to cook our dinner; it looks like a Charlie Chaplin assembly line if we have the right background music playing.</p><p>We eat. Sometimes in front of the TV, sometimes at our brand-new first-owned dining table. I compulsively pick up the dishes to go wash them, sometimes regrettably before she's even done eating her dinner. The dishwasher is full, so I might as well run it. The laundry hamper is full, and I'm getting low on t-shirts to wear to work - should probably do a load.</p><p>By the time I start relaxing, it's either too late to play any music (might wake up the neighbors) or I burnt myself out just tidying up the place. But for me, having control over my house grants me the calm I need to relax &amp; think creatively. It's not obsessive-compulsive (maybe it is? Who knows/cares); but it's a mental exercise that keeps me proud of what I've got around me. Most of us go through days (even weekends) without thinking much at all - at work, at social events (which take less thought than the decision whether to even go), even when trying to write something (yeah, that's a stab at lazy blogging conventions, so what?).</p><p>For a long time I tried to force creativity, dedicating whole evenings in front of a MIDI keyboard trying to compose - but instead of writing any great melodies, I ended up lazily repeating the same riff I'd written years prior over and over for 3 hours with nothing new or different. My head was in the wrong space during those forced moments; obsessively organizing my home life seems to correct that. I've learned to love the process, even though it's sort of compulsive by now.</p><p>Also, Alicia loves not having to do dishes or laundry, so win-win.</p>
