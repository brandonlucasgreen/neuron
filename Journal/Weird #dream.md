Weird #dream.
We were living in London, and I won some contest to have lunch/tea with the queen. I go and she never shows up but I end u having lunch with this other old woman who claims to be part of the royal family but I don’t know her. She kind of looked like June Squibb but I don’t think it was her. 

It was weird. I don’t know if we had a good conversation. I think I was just anxiously waiting around in a fancy cafe.
