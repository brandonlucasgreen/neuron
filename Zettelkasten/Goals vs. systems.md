Systems I have and are working:
- Reminders as a quick capture AND process of getting things done. Talking to Siri is invaluable, even on my watch, even when it's not 100% reliable -- it's *good enough* in the vast majority of cases. Reminders as an app interface is, again, good enough for deciding what's important and what I need to do now vs. later, AND because the capture method is so good, it makes it naturally a good to-do list manager itself.

Systems under evaluation:
- Idea capture via Zettelkasten. The concept appears to be working, but I need to figure out whether it's working because it's an excuse to tinker with something new, or I actually am capturing ideas. Keep tabs on this.
 - Meta: Tinkering vs. system/habit forming
- Exercise - the Apple Watch activity rings tell me I'm getting exercise from dog walks/playing, but is it enough? Should I be doing other things, like stretching or core/arm strength? How do I systemetize those things? Does [Fitness+][2] help?

Does anything else need a system?
- Family / marriage time: This seems to be working organically, not sure if it needs a system. That is: I seem to be doing good in my relationship with Alicia, talking with parents frequently, closer with sister, etc.
