# Simplifying capture of ideas
I have for too long relied on my memory for things. I am both getting older _and_ my responsibilities are growing, so I need to deal with this in a better way.

Rather than setting a goal to capture notes every day, I’m going to build a system so it’s unavoidable. I’ve never found goals to really work for me — I easily defer or water down said goals to the point where achieving them feels unsatisfying, if I even achieve anything at all. Systems, on the other hand, seem to work well for me. The blogpost [[Goals vs. systems]] by seemed to capture why well.

Some goals and requirements:
- Must be possible across all platforms: macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS if possible
- Must be in as few clicks/taps/steps as possible; ideally, the writing of the idea is the first of those steps as to avoid distraction or loss
- Make it easy to leverage the zettelkasten to link related ideas later. Any text editor will work to allow for this, but ideally one that recognizes backlinks

### Evolving ecosystem
I’m trying a [Zettelkasten][1] approach, leveraging an open-source framework called [Neuron][2]. Of course I’m adopting a method championed by Germany, with my love for both structure and an extremely thoughtful approach to it.

Tools in use:
- **GitHub** for hosting the Zettelkasten (currently called `brain`)
- **Ulysses** for long-form writing and Zettel (atomic idea) processing
- **Working Copy** for publishing to the `brain` from iOS
- **Shortcuts** for quick capture on iOS/iPadOS/watchOS — *TODO: publish shortcut*
- **Alfred 4** for quick capture on macOS
- **GitHub Desktop** for publishing from macOS. *I don’t love this currently and am looking for a different approach*
