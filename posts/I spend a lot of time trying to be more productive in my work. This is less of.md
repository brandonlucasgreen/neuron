I spend a lot of time trying to be more productive in my work. This is less of an issue in terms of actually getting things done, but more an issue of getting *the right* things done first - and relentlessly staying obsessively organized. Of course, it takes time to figure out the right things to work on, and sometimes I blow a ton of time figuring that out - so I need a good solution to help me with that. 

In doing so, I then waste a lot of trying to optimize my own system for project management. The amount of articles and opinions on how to optimize your productivity is absurd; it really comes down to what works best for you. I've found a system that seems to work for me. 

1. I rely way too much on reminders via Siri, and like having those as part of the full list of things I need to do.
2. I like the clean UI of iOS8/Yosemite, and most non-Apple apps force other UI conventions on you that may or may not complement OSX/iOS nicely.
3. Evernote is great for self-project managing, when there's a lot of notes to be kept in the background. I use its Reminders feature less as a tool for actual reminders, and more as a running list of active projects I have going on. (The individual tasks of those projects, however, usually end up as a messy checklist in the Evernote note or in my reminders somewhere else - annoying.)
4. Collaborative projects are managed in Trello - no exceptions at this point. It's become my favorite, simplest way of manage everything from technical projects, album releases, to this blog. 
5. I like the ability to share lists (say, with Alicia or my parents) - which virtually every task management app offers. Wunderlist prides itself on this, but realistically I’m not finding myself collaborating with a ton of people on lists. I find Trello much stronger for true collaboration, but weak on task list management. The stock Apple Reminders gets the job done for, say, sharing a grocery list. 
6. I don’t like having to manage multiple apps/platforms for essentially the same thing. In other words, the less apps I need to pay attention to, the better. 

So I discovered GoodTask (http://goodtaskapp.com), which essentially layers over Apple’s Reminders and gives me the features and flexibility that Apple didn’t build themselves. It can either fully replace Reminders, or act as a more elaborate version of Reminders for involved project management, depending on your need. There’s a few minor quirks (including some rare crashing), and it’s not free ($20 for desktop, $5 for iOS) - but no monthly subscription and no juggling multiple platforms. This seems to have made my setup work:

- All reminders, project-related tasks and lists are in GoodTask (via Reminders)
- All new tasks are stored in an Inbox list, and then delegated to Home, Work, Creative or Reminders (for things I really don't care about until I'm reminded)
- Tasks related to collaborative work (ie. things that colleagues need to know about) stay in Trello. All tasks that are personal to me stay in GoodTask/Reminders. For instance, if I have to wireframe something that needs peer or client review, that stays in the UX Trello board for that client, with me as the assignee and a published due date. 
	- I may create a separate reminder in GoodTask so I remember to start work the week prior, but that's personal to me.
- Special lists for certain things I put together on a constant basis (ie. Groceries)
- Every big project, app or client gets a smart hashtag in GoodTask, which corresponds to a catch-all project note in Evernote
- All !!!-level tasks in GoodTask show up in an "important" smart list

This seems to be working well for me - that is, until a new app comes out that I feel compelled to try.
