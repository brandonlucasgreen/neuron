# Engaged, tone deaf & color blind

I proposed to Alicia over the weekend. It took almost a year, but I finally did it. I had a [custom engagement ring][1] made and I took her out to a [beautiful dinner overlooking Boston Common][2] and I walked her around the [Public Garden][3] and then we celebrated at the [Omni Parker House][4]. 

Simple, but classic us.

The amount of anxiety that you get when trying to pull off a proposal is staggering. It’s not even necessarily the *hardest* decision of your life — since we’re madly in love with each other and it was a no-brainer — but it’s still a massive commitment that relies on a level of faith & confidence in both the relationship and oneself. I had wanted to say something ultra-romantic and profound before getting down on my knee…but I totally choked under my own anxiety. I ended up just kissing her repeatedly to hide my sweating and buy myself time to figure out something to say.

**Which is when I reminded myself, again:** if you really love someone (or something, for that matter), why the anxiety at all? Drop the anxiety. [Just do it][5]. 

So I did! And now we can call each other our fiancés.

Oh, here are some pictures of us being cute and engaged and stuff.
