# Google sometimes drops the ball because Google is a massive company
The other day I finally subscribed to [Connected][1], a great consumer tech podcast, and in their most recent episode, [Federico][2] rants about the inconsistent feature support across Google's iOS apps. (He [ranted about it 2 months prior][3], and the [rant still stands][4].) They've failed to provide consistent support for now-core iPad features, including support for the iPad Pro's bigger screen and Split View. How can you write in Google Docs and do research simultaneously without split view?

Not even being sarcastic. **I have to imagine it’s really annoying and hard.** If I had an iPad Pro, I'd probably agree with him; in fact I'd probably stop using those apps altogether until Google made them work for me. It sucks even more to notice that Google has updated *some* of their apps with support for these features. But why not the others, arguably the ones that are the most widely used purely in a productivity context?

I was listening to his rant on my way into work - a place of work where I am one of over 4,000 employees. I started thinking about the different projects that are in flight at any given time within my company and reminded myself: I have no idea who is held accountable for some of those projects. **Who knows if they have the same priorities that I do?** In just nine months at my current company, I've had to deal with multiple fits and starts around projects that involved multiple key teams, only to find out that those teams suddenly had to prioritize these same projects completely differently than mine, due to other external factors beyond my control. 

Google is an even more massive organization. It has over 10,000 employees working on any number of products or initiatives. There are teams of hundreds dedicated to Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Drive, even just the different iterations of messaging (Hangouts & Voice & Chat across all platforms). Each of those teams contain different people, each with strengths and weaknesses and a certain propensity to work harder or less hard than others, or even make occasional mistakes. They also may have different priorities, backlogs and possibly even internal politics.

**We have to remind ourselves that each of these factors may translate into different results per product.** I would bet that Drive (which coincidentally I think is one of the best Google apps on iOS) has a lot more of its core functionality together and had the capacity to fit split-view support into its roadmap shortly after it was announced. Docs (or more specifically, Docs for iOS) is probably run by a different team that still hasn’t been able to prioritize one of these features. Or perhaps they have it built and in a testing phase, but some QA analyst ran into a massive, crippling bug that Spilt View caused in Docs for iOS but was not a problem in the other iOS apps. Maybe there’s another feature they’ve been pushing for that took precedence over Split View or caused a UX problem when rendering on the larger iPad Pro screen. 

Remember when [Google+ finally got its Material Design update for iOS almost a year after it did for Android][5], even after people declared it dead? Why does the Google Analytics, one of the most widely used Google business tools, have a [terrible iOS app with an outdated icon and no 6+ screen support][6]? When was the last time anyone tried out [Google Earth for iOS][7]? Did you even know that [Google has a dedicated Street View app][8] separate from Google Maps? Who decided to make that?

These apps are different priorities for different teams under the same friendly Google brand, so we can’t be surprised when their adoption of features or design principles aren’t totally consistent.

Managing a product roadmap is hard. Managing a roadmap for a single product that plays nice with the roadmaps of other products under a single company is exponentially harder. As frustrating as it can be to see individual products under a brand fall behind others, it’s worth reminding ourselves about these difficulties - especially with amazing new features on which we rely in some contexts of our daily lives.
