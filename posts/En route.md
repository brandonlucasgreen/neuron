# En route
I’m currently with my wife in France, en route to Berlin, where we’ll be living for at least a year. My company is sending me there to do some product management things for its relatively young European business; more generally, we’re using it as an opportunity to live outside the US during a both personally and politically anxious time.
I don’t want to talk any more about politics, since that’s basically all that American news talks about and it’s all stress all the time, so instead, here’s a picture of the lake Alicia and I are sitting next to:

This is Lac Annecy, a large lake next to a small and very cute city in Southeast France, right near the Alps. We’re here to detox from life for a few days before re-immersing in a somewhat different one in Germany.
Because I naturally assimilate into the culture around me instead of actually trying to relax, here are a few quick observations about life in Annecy:
- Service in restaurants is slower, but also it’s so pleasant that I rarely ever mind.
- Everyone says *bonjour*, *bonsoir*, *pardon* and *au revoir* to each other - almost no exceptions. It doesn’t feel fake either; the locals seem genuinely cordial and kind, almost like a European version of Southern hospitality. If you don’t speak English, there is a genuine attempt to try and make the language barrier work (though the variability of English understanding here is wide).
- I feel like an asshole trying to fake French, realize I don’t know what I’m saying, and then asking for English. I need to learn German quickly.
- Espresso is *much* better than coffee here. The best espresso.

I hear the coffee is fantastic in Berlin.
