Hey! I’m a product leader, music maker, remote work advocate, writer, husband and father. I live and work in central Massachusetts with my [wife][1], daughter and [doggo][2]. I love digging into the deeply human psychology behind the problems we face and thinking toward the right solutions. 🤘🏻

[Book time][8] | [Email me][4] | [Twitter][6] | [LinkedIn][7]

I'm currently employed by [Wayfair][12], leading the product team managing our experimentation platform, tools and culture. I also enjoy pour-over coffee, DIYing my house, [making music][10] and occasionally writing.

*Previously: [🎨 Abstract][9], [💍 CustomMade][13], [🎧 Audiodrops][14], [📢 Sonicbids][15]*

I sometimes refine and publish ideas on tech, working and self-improvement as a newsletter called **tone deaf color blind.** It's been on a sort of hiatus due to the birth of my daughter, but all my previous writing is online for your enjoyment.
