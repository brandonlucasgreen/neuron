Hey! I‚Äôm a product leader, music maker, remote work advocate, writer, husband and father. I live and work in central Massachusetts with my [wife][1], daughter and [doggo][2]. I love digging into the deeply human psychology behind the problems we face and thinking toward the right solutions. ü§òüèª

[[Blog]] | [Book time][8] | [Email me][4] | [Twitter][6] | [LinkedIn][7]

I'm currently employed by [Wayfair][12], leading the product team managing our experimentation platform, tools and culture. I also enjoy pour-over coffee, DIYing my house, [making music][10] and occasionally writing.

*Previously: [üé® Abstract][9], [üíç CustomMade][13], [üéß Drops][14], [üì¢ Sonicbids][15]*

### [tone deaf color blind &rarr;][11]
I sometimes refine and publish ideas on tech, working and self-improvement in the face of impostor syndrome as a newsletter called **tone deaf color blind.** It's been on a sort of hiatus due to the birth of my daughter, but all my previous writing is online for your enjoyment.

### [sophomores &rarr;][10]
I sometimes write songs and release them under the alias **Sophomores**. I've released 6 albums to date, mostly in the genres of synthpop, industrial rock and alternative rock. All of my music is available online for free on Bandcamp, [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/311HUT6dPGAfIekpDFD45o) and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sophomores/676742660).
