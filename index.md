Hey! I’m a product manager & builder, music maker/snob, remote work advocate, writer, husband and DIY enthusiast. I live and work in central Massachusetts with my [wife][1] and [dog][2]. I love digging into the deeply human psychology behind how and why people solve problems, and helping to create more solutions to help people.  

This site is a Zettelkasten, a way for me to think and develop ideas out in the open.
