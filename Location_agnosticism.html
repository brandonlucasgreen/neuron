In July 2019 I was living in a smallish townhouse in a suburb of Boston, easily commutable to Wayfair’s central HQ in the bustling Back Bay neighborhood but ever-so-slightly quieter and cheaper than downtown. My first day working for Abstract was weird in a sense: I was still paying overpriced rent for a climate-controlled box, but instead of leaving, I was taking three or four hours of Zoom calls from said box. It was both urban and disappointingly disconnected. I relished the opportunity for sustained “focus time” at my desk in the tiny second bedroom Alicia and I shared as an “office,” but I still had to take a train or bus to a decent coffee shop or co-working space if I wanted to get away.</p><p>Nevertheless I loved the <em>underlying principles</em> of remote work (or, to be precise, distributed work): a team need not be co-located or working synchronously in order to solve great problems, and an individual can perform better in a space they control and are comfortable with. So when my wife and I decided that being near nature was more important that being near a city, we leaned further into it: we cashed out most of the equity I was extremely fortunate to have accumulated from my tenure at Wayfair and bought a house, not in a connected suburb of Boston but a rural town over an hour away from the city limits. Not in the middle of <em>nowhere</em>, but twenty minutes’ drive from an interstate highway in a town offering the “right to farm.” Fortunately, we got pretty lucky with the house: not perfect but with great bones, well in the bounds of what we could afford, and in a nice, safe neighborhood over farmland next to a forest. Not everyone is so lucky or privileged.</p><p>The lockdowns started four months in. As I noted two weeks ago, I struggled a bit with depression and nihilism while watching the pandemic spread and our government prove incapable of the basic management of it. Nevertheless, my family was extremely fortunate to realize that, in spite of being unable to engage in “normal society,” we were able to bring important aspects of it into our home to replicate the aspects of it we missed most, like the coffee shops I used to frequent and the meals I used to crave at my favorite spots. We started FaceTiming almost weekly with our parents and siblings, and now feel closer to them than ever. I took on new hobbies (mainly centered around improving the house) and creative outlets (like writing this) to fill time previously spent at shows, bars with coworkers, and warehouse practice spaces with musician friends.</p><p>This is what we chose to do. Not everyone thrives in a rural environment. What was most important about the past year of discovery wasn’t that we should all move to peace &amp; quiet, but that the situation in 2021 enables us to be and have exactly what we want, pretty much anywhere. I didn’t attempt to replicate my old music hangs, but if I wanted to, I had the option to pretend I was at a show, courtesy of Instagram Live and Patreon and others, or in a warehouse practice space thanks to those same platforms and tools like Zoom, Twitch and JamKazam, if I so pleased. I could even sign up for <a href="https://www.bso.org/brands/bso/features/bso-now.aspx">high-definition live performance video of my city’s symphony orchestra</a> to re-live the joy of the lower balcony of Boston’s Symphony Hall. With a middle-of-the-road TV and surround sound system (or even a couple of HomePods) in 2021, it comes damn close to the real thing.</p><p>4K video and livestreaming are absolutely <em>not</em> a replacement for in-person entertainment, but it has closed the gap a bit, and that gap will only get smaller over time such that you won’t need to live in a major city to experience the happenings exclusive to the major city.</p><h2 id="what-is-location-agnosticism">What is location agnosticism?</h2><p>The idea of location agnosticism is this: <strong>Anything I want to have or do is available at my fingertips, no matter where I am, and in the format with which I am most comfortable.</strong></p><p>This is not simply about defining a methodology for remote work. It’s a methodology that can govern many—or all—aspects of your life, as you see fit. The beauty of location agnosticism is that it can</p><p>This is not an excuse for homebody-ism. Sure, I love being at and around my house, but I also get stir crazy. We all crave social interaction. I talk to my neighbors at a social distance and occasionally enjoy the light banter of my mask-covered grocery cashier. I</p><p>This is not something only homeowners or rural dwellers to leverage.</p><p>This is not digital nomadism, either. I don’t want my possessions to be location agnostic just so I can sell my house and freely travel the world — I also like being at home. A lot. But city-dwellers who love living in cities, or nomads who love to travel the world whenever they please, should have access to the most important things to them in their location of choice.</p><p>And in 2021 we’re quite close to that being a reality, <em>not thanks to AR or VR</em>, but because of some key advances in a few technology spaces and, more importantly, the mindset shift that the COVID-19 pandemic forced upon many of us.</p><h2 id="whats-enabled-this">What’s enabled this</h2><p>There have been a few recent developments that I feel have made location agnosticism more possible than ever before, in late 2020 and early 2021. Upon reflection, I cannot emphasize how grateful I am for the list of innovations I am about to walk through:</p><p><strong>The pandemic.</strong> <strong>The Apple Silicon Mac lineup.</strong> <strong>Reliable noise-canceling headphones.</strong> <strong>Reliable virtual desktopping.</strong> <strong>Reliable video collaboration.</strong> <strong>Smarter, unified smart home technology.</strong> <strong>Increased financial options and improved access to financial information &amp; best practices.</strong> <strong>Access to affordable food &amp; health product via Amazon and other online vendors.</strong> Some examples from the past few months: We just bought a portable treadmill for $300 so Alicia could go on walks without having to risk slipping her pregnant body on ice.</p><p>Miss amusement parks? <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJqu6F1gr8u/?igshid=e51xrtgdabnt">This guy tried to replicate Disney World for his kids</a>. Was it perfect? No, but a toddler wouldn’t notice.</p><h2 id="but-we-cant-do-it-alone">But we can’t do it alone</h2><p>I often wonder how happy (or depressed) I’d be if I was alone in this house. (Of course, if I was not married, I’d probably have no reason to buy a house in rural Massachusetts and my life would look quite different). Having a spouse and dog I love, plus a child on the way, are truly the elements that made our version of location agnostic living an enjoyable way to live.</p><p>I wonder how the ideas of companionship and roommates will shift as the developed world shifts. Not to say that I believe nobody should live alone — I wanted this for myself for a long time — but I wonder about the mental well-being of those living alone while respecting the seriousness of the pandemic. ::In TV and movies, there’s often the trope of the hacker personality living alone, endlessly staring at a computer screen or the lenses of a VR headset, as a means of coping with loneliness or social anxiety. One of my favorite shows of all time, <em>Mr. Robot</em>, centers around one of these characters.::</p><h2 id="where-we-could-keep-going">Where we could keep going</h2><p>So much of basic services and infrastructure is enabling location-agnostic living, but there’s still so much further to go. If the pandemic doesn’t end quickly, or we find ourselves in another one soon after, there will continue to be massive investments in helping people live more of their lives at home.</p><p>So many restaurants have not only shifted toward takeout and delivery to sustain their business, but have even begun selling their recipes &amp; ingredients to customers. And why not? Why scour the internet for a recipe you’ll struggle to get right, or deal with the repetitive mediocrity of services like HelloFresh, when you can <em>choose</em> to get amazing food from your local restaurant of choice or have them enable a fun at-home cooking experience for you and your family? But this only goes so far: you’re location-locked. There is a decent Mexican family-style restaurant in my town, but what if I want a particular dish from this Venezuelan dive I loved in Bushwick? There’s a realistic future in which I could order the ingredients and recipe from that restaurant’s website, powered by Shopify, and have them shipped to my house four hours away. As a customer I don’t care whether they necessarily came <em>from</em> the physical restaurant location, as long as I know exactly how to recreate the amazing shredded beef arepas I so dearly miss to this day. Were they deep-fried? I don’t remember, but if so, I can get a deep fryer from Amazon in a day or two for 60 bucks.</p><h3 id="on-privilege-location--minimalism">On privilege, location &amp; minimalism</h3><p>As I wrote this, I kept thinking about how much of the concept of location agnosticism is one of luxury: I need</p><p>One does not need next-day delivery from Amazon to achieve a location-agnostic lifestyle.
