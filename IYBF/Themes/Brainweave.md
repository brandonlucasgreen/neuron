# Brainweave
A framework to connect any application to the human mind and its contents. Several applications have been written using the Brainweave framework:
- `yrFriend` - installs an “inner monologue” that acts as one’s personal companion
- `Mind Eraser` - enables the ability to delete memories from one’s brain
- `MaDaMe_weAver` - simulates the effects of MDMA
- `hiveMind` - enables sharing of two+ brains’ contents with each other

BrainWeave makes a statistically significant decision on what the hive mind’s accepted truth should be based on the most widely accepted truth amongst its individual contributors. If everyone believes in a lie, that lie becomes truth for the hive mind.
