# Education and dialogue in the new United States
By 2025, most education standards are repealed by states, and those that aren’t have liberal “opt out” policies that allow states to effectively educate their students on whatever they want with no incentive toward one subject or another.

The demand from students and their parents is to teach them ways to make money in an increasingly competitive global economy, and that results in many public schools teaching their kids *media studies* exclusively: social media tactics, conduct, theory, etc. Kids raised in this system are essentially taught to bolster and monetize their own public profiles, while also learning critical reading & thinking skills to help them carefully scrutinize the profiles of others.

This leads to a variety of results across each nation:
- NAU is a culture of extreme nuance, largely driven by the NYC and MIT schools of thought. Conversations are long and winding, children are extremely smart and clever & excellent at the STEM disciplines, but struggle socially in the conventional sense. 
- California is a culture of one-topic celebrities for everything.
