Aaron didn’t care for most of the people living near his cottage. Most of them haven’t tried out YrFriend — in fact, most people in rural New Hampshire weren’t aware at all of BrainWeave or 8chan or the dark web — but he did appreciate the extreme diversity of his neighbors.

The Free Region is so-called because we residents are supposedly able to live completely free of the shackles of a centralized governing body. It’s basically a barter system; we stole it from the old New Hampshire slogan. “Live Free or Die.” Or rather, Live Free or Come Up With Whatever Form Of Order This Group Naturally Resorts To, which in our case was a bit like feudalism and socialism became frenemies. 




















It’s funny because most of the New Hampshire folks ended up migrating back into New New England when things split up. Now, it’s mostly fucking Mainers around. Mainers are the ones who make the Free Region seem crazy and barbaric to the rest of the New American Nations. Mainers are a strange mix: the fahkin’ lobstah rolls or the awful pseudo-Boston accent or perpetual mumble or a hydroponic setup in the basement or a basement filled with shotguns and a ton of these absurd beards that grow way too long. Mainers with villages named after rival cities and countries of the formerly united States of America. 

China, Maine. China. There’s a town in Maine called China.

In fact, find and list all towns in former Maine whose names equal that of a country other than the former United States of America.

There’s a Mexico, Maine, too? Poland? What the fuck? 

Then again, every town or city is named after something or someone else. This rickety little cottage sits in a forest spanning what used to be called Hillsborough, a town in the state formerly known as New Hampshire. That was named after the Earl of Hillsborough, which bore its name from one Wills Hill, who was one of many British men bearing the surname Hill, the others likely having their own towns and cities names Hillsborough after them.
