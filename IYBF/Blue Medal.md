# Blue Medal
At one point in his life, Aaron Andrew Baxter was a classically trained pianist. His mother began taking him to lessons at the age of five and, after demonstrating great skill in his first year, entered him into local competitions throughout the Greater New Haven metropolitan area of southern Connecticut. In one case he won first prize: the blue medal, awarded to the best classical pianist under eight years of age in New Haven County. 

==Tell the story of the medal==

The medal is still suspended from the rusted brass reading lamp atop the mahogany upright piano in his parents’ house, the whole thing covered in dust. The keys haven’t been tuned in years. Aaron never bothered to take his medal from its grimy domicile; it reminded him of the falsehood that winning is the most satisfying result of any contest.

Since moving to his parents’ cottage, he wrote six pieces for solo piano and occasionally performed them for Talia and himself. He learned how to play the entire Beatles discography on the piano, excluding “Revolution 9.” He also created a science fiction podcast called *Back on Black Holes*, which ran inconsistently for two years and generated seventy-eight total listeners. He taught himself how to play the electric guitar, bass guitar, trombone, mbira and theremin. At another point he learned how to build things from wood, including: a small, wobbly oak card table, a set of built-in bookshelves, two raised flower beds and a wire fence to keep animals out of said flower beds, and a staircase railing deemed unsafe for children. He learned to cook steak and seafood on a charcoal grill, and Talia taught him how to make a tolerable chicken soup using an Instant Pot before she left.



> Of course, the one thing Aaron didn’t create entirely on his own was the one that fundamentally changed how humans think and behave. He would like to think that he did the heavy lifting to create YrBestFriend, but in reality he stole the underlying framework for it — the piece that made it possible to capture and digitize brain activity — from a previous employer. 

> He had already created his own developer profile for the two games he created during his tenure at the Aceso Interactive Corporation, neither of which garnered much attention, so it was simple enough to publish a third application for public consumption. The name of his public developer profile was Blue Medal Software. He named it so out of spite toward his mother.
