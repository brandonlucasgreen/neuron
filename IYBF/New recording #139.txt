# New recording #139
Record this:

Sun, high up in the sky over the front. 
Sunset in the back, over an empty chair.
Read all the books that you can.
There’s terror still of the unknown.
A rocking chair on wheels is not a place for a girl like you.
What can I do to put some hope inside my baby’s heart?
