# Jackie
Of course she was the one to fucking show up with it.

If anyone still gave a shit about academic traditions and opportunities to show off, of course it was her. What is it about women named Jackie? Does the name Jackie have some etymology tied to busy-body or nosiness or something? Why has every single Jackie I’ve met in my life been so fucking pushy? Why couldn’t she have decided to go by something nicer, like Jacqueline? All else equal, if she had done that, she would have been so so so much nicer to deal with.

Jesus. I hadn’t seen Jackie Childress since high school. Totally instantly recognized her though and it all came back to me. She basically ran everything at school: yearbook committee, student government, the debate team. I guess she also handles alumni projects. Field hockey too? God, if high school was actually a serious oligarchy, she’d be the one in the middle pulling all the strings in her favor. I never slept with her, though. 

Why does my head always jump to that? I’m sorry; I certainly don’t hate women and I don’t only think about fucking women and there’s at least a few women around here I certainly would not sleep with. So that’s fine. Right?

But I wonder what it would be like to do so now. To sleep with Jackie Childress. Everyone had always said — by everyone, I mean the couple of debate team sluts who did, because she certainly had no time to play the role of bicycle — she administered the bedroom just like she did her student government. 

I can’t believe she found my actual Bzzr username. I still can’t believe she figured out that the only network I was still on was Bzzr and actually decided to voice chat with me.

That’s determination, though, I guess? If she was honestly that determined she could have easily figured out my fake Instagram or Facebook or Reddit or YouTube or Twitter or Snapchat profile and messaged me there. Though I probably wouldn’t have noticed it sitting alongside the literally millions of spam messages, and it certainly wouldn’t have looked like the actual me. Twenty years and billions of dollars in platform development and only a bunch of digital landfills full of creepy advertisements to show for it. I wonder if  anymore.

Jackie still uses Instagram, which is hilarious given where we are as a human race. I think it last put her in Dixieland, possibly married and definitely showcasing her seven-year-old’s violin chops. Did you know that those beautiful melodies came out of her seven-year-old? And that he was only seven years old? And that she's the oh so proud mother who is so so blessed to have her amazing seven-year-old? I wonder if her kid has a BrainWeave chip. 

What was that terrible sweater she was wearing last Christmas at some party in the Nashville sprawl? I bet there was an ugly sweater contest and she won it. I bet she found the kitschiest store she could find in the outskirts of Nashville, somewhere really far out there on a lake in the middle of nowhere Tennessee, and she added her own extra ribbon and coloring and that fucking row of bells down the front of the shirt — just for the high of winning. 

I thought ugly sweater parties died out in the ‘10s anyway. Then again, I thought the same with high school reunions. Maybe I’ve just been missing out.

Yes, Jackie Childress, even if you weren’t watching me, I was certainly watching you. Why go through all this effort to get me to come to your Twenty Year High School Reunion?

Baxter, do you think I should go?
Do you?
Do you think it’ll be worth it?
Huh. I should at least write it down.

Baxter, set a reminder for my high school reunion on November twenty-second, twenty twenty-seven. Two weeks in advance. Also log a dull headache in the left side of my brain. Log left shoulder pain, minor, shaky hands, moderate. Thinking about this has made me anxious. 

Oh — I have a chip in my head, too. Baxter is my name, and it’s also the name that Athene Human Interactive Corp gave their memory backup software. I was on the team that worked on it, and they thought my surname sounded like that of a good, obedient butler for the mind. I swear it’s not as crazy as if I were talking to myself. Not these days at least.

“You are cordially invited to the Woodbury Hills Regional High School Class of 2006 reunion. 20 years! Featuring DJ Twin Tower” — oof, that’s in poor taste — “playing all the hits from the turn of the millennium. Spouses and children welcome!”

Baxter, do you count as a spouse? You’re in my head, but I think of you as my significant other. My conscience. My incorruptible voice of reason. But you don’t talk back to me. You just remember stuff for me. My stenographer. Not all wives are stenographers, but they have to let you in with me. 

I bet Jackie’ll have her fucking kid there. She’s the type who would absolutely exploit her star child, forcing him to tag along just to be shown off to as many attendees as she could steal a conversation with. The kid happens to be a solid violinist and was in a reality talent show pilot two years ago. But no matter — whenever Jackie is around, violin and talent shows are the most important things in the world, and her kid was the best at them. She would always know how to land herself in the exceptional bucket with shit like that. Not like she abused the power she inevitably seemed to have, but more like she pushed that power in as many directions as it could naturally go. 

Overwhelming. That’s what she was. A weighted blanket that talked.

She recognized you, Baxter. When I talked to her.

Well — I mean, she recognized me. My voice. She remembered my voice, but not from high school. The one in her head. She could’ve sworn it was mine and then asked herself something and then said it was mine. 
  
She knew about you and how you sound like me, Baxter. I wonder if she’s involved.

How could she know at this point? She was never that tech-savvy, and even if she did have the nerve to inject a BrainWeave chip in her head, there’s no way she’d figure out how to navigate the dark web. Did they have the complete lack of foresight to deploy you publicly already? Why would they have done that? How could they, after everything that’s happened in testing so far — how quickly it got out into the dark web — how easily your code would be to manipulate in its current state? The only reason I keep you recording is because I won’t fuck with you.

How many people could have you installed by now? 
Tens of thousands? 
Millions?
In the northeast? The entire content?
Ugh, fuck!

This is bad, right? Yeah, probably bad. Could it be bad? Is this a joke? Did someone from the company find her and send her here out of spite? Told her the whole “Aaron’s got an app attached to his brain stem” story, planted the little seed about you just to rattle me? 

Maybe she’s just in the beta program. This is probably nothing.

Maybe it’s real. Maybe they fixed you up just enough to release publicly. Maybe someone else released it as their own after it leaked? Oh god, I hope they scaled you back a lot. How would they even have marketed you? “A permanent home for your memories?” Why would Jackie have bought into that? I’m sure she thinks her memory is just fine. What does Jackie talk to you about? 

What would they do with that information?

I should have messaged her back. I should have asked her questions. Why didn’t I just ask her? I—I think I was in shock. That has to be it, right? I need to know what they did with you. I can still do that. 

She’s offline. Fuck. She’s not even listed anymore. Fuck. Did she delete her Bzzr account? Fifteen minutes after we talked? Fuck! What is this about?
