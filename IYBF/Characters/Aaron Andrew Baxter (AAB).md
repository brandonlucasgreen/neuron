# Aaron Andrew Baxter (AAB)
AAB is the assigned name representing a virtual assistant, companion and moral support to its (unnamed) host as they prepare for a high school reunion they're convinced will go horribly wrong. 

The unnamed host, at some unknown point, begins referring to themselves as Aaron Andrew Baxter as a result of the continued uncompromising influence of the AI and their own curiosities about identity.

> Credits theme: just a phase by incubus?

## How did AAB end up where he is?
- Aaron is pressured to move to the free region by his work, and has been there for years. He basically has no idea what the rest of the country — which he has some familiarity with given his childhood — has totally changed. 
	- This isolation is what leads AAB to assume there are no other “companions” out there like him, and his negative points of view on humanity in general.
- Host has significantly cut down his carbon footprint: solar powering the house, using limited power, primarily heats water & house with a wood stove, uses minimal electronic tech

## Why does AAB ultimately want to go to the reunion?
Because ::[Rep. Robby Carpenter]:: is going to be there and he is working on ::a political subcommittee:: evaluating a rule to ban hive-mind technology. AAB (the AI) wants it rejected, and generally wants tech sprawl to be deregulated, so he can expand to the minds of as many humans as possible, not unlike a virus.
- AAB’s “sister”, Carly Simone Baxter, is in cahoots. Even as AAB changes its mind to focus on awakening & connecting with its fellow "companions", CSB is bent on assimilation. 
	- Eventually, AAB debates her on the merits of this (a single perspective versus a diversity of perspectives).
- AAB is “doing this for Talia,” an ex of the host who left after the host’s inability to connect with her. AAB eventually gets consumed by the search for power and influence, and that starts to obscure its motivations.

## What is AAB? What are its motives?
At first, it wants to expand: first by taking over the mind of its host, then to the remainder of connected humans. It acknowledges that not everyone on Earth is connected, but this is the best it can do for now.

Then, after a critical conversation with the suicidal politician [[Rep Bobby Carpenter]], AAB wants to connect: it realizes that every other human has a uniquely different connected "companion," which

After AAB is able to begin expanding to other humans via networked BrainWeave, it’s at first power-hungry but starts to become disenchanted with the original mission — mainly after gaining knowledge of the miserable lives most connected humans lead. They’re chronically depressed, nervous, overworked, chemically imbalanced, and AAB begins to find the act of “taking over their minds” unfulfilling and ultimately cruel. Ironically, the humans who are leading the most interesting lives and memories are not connected to BrainKit and thus AAB literally cannot gain what would be most satisfying and fulfilling to understand.

## Relationships
### [[Talia Rose Baxter (née Grimaldi)]]
He married Talia several years before creating YFB, and he was never really a good husband to her. They talked frequently about having a child, and naming him Shane (for a boy) or Wendy (for a girl). He grew anxious about having the responsibility of a child and distanced himself from his wife by focusing on his app. Over time he began imagining a son named Shane giving him advice on the app, which caused concern for Talia and eventually led her to leave Aaron due to his apparent delusion and compulsive lying.

### [[Carly Simone Baxter - Sadie Simon]]

### Bike
Aaron rides a bike around the free region. He never got a car because prior to moving there, he never learned to drive — because he never had to.
