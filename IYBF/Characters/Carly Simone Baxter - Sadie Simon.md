# Carly Simone Baxter / Sadie Simon
**Carly** is Aaron’s sister, posing as Sadie, a celebrity singer & influencer with a foot in the political door. She wants to advance Baxter forward such that it enables a “hive mind” for all its hosts. She’s doing this for selfish reasons.

She is hopelessly addicted to various social media platforms, most notably Instagram and YouTube. She lives in the Northeast American Union (NAU), drifting between Albany and New York City.
Carly has an unhealthy, acrimonious celebrity obsession with **Sadie Simon**, a former child star and current recording artist. During her childhood, Carly was an aspiring child star in her own right, but lost a child singing competition to Sadie in a meltdown—and when she tried to reach out to Sadie to reconcile and partner on an acting project, Sadie condescendingly rejected her.

This sent Carly into a spiral, causing her to obsess over Sadie. She gradually changed her appearance to look like a young adult Sadie, and eventually tracked Sadie down to “replace” (murder) her. Carly then took on Sadie’s identity, integrated into Sadie’s living family and began an “incestuous” affair with her older brother, Bob. It is through this affair that Bob learns about the app Carly’s brother, Tye, is working on, named Your Friend Baxter. 

- She is put under immense pressure by her mother to be a great singer and child celebrity.
	- This led to a complex but close relationship with her brother Tye. They would frequently act out in front of their parents, with arguments getting violent;  in private, however, they formed a tight familial bond. Over the year Tye would continue to keep her updated on his progress building YFB.
- 
- In 2024, she serendipitously meets a man named Bob Simon at an upscale bar in New York City named BAR, where high-ranking government employees frequent.

Her influence on NAU politics is evident through her relationship with her “brother” Bob Simon. After YFB is co-opted by the NAU government and helps it become prosperous via selling direct-inception ad space to major corporations, “Sadie” Carly pushes Bob to propose legislation to **develop YFB into a sort of “hive-mind” solution for participants** — she selfishly wants this to retain access to all the goings on in the NAU (to supplement her social media addiction).
