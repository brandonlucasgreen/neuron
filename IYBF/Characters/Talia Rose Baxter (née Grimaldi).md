# Talia Rose Baxter (n√©e Grimaldi)
**Talia** is an ex-wife of the unnamed host, working as a freelance photographer around the California Republic. Her story is Kafkaesque such that she keeps getting runaround from those connected to the BrainKit network


She has been traveling around the California Republic and other adjacent blue nations, documenting the trialing and rollout of YFB.
- Nearly 4 years in, she begins noticing that her subjects start all talking about similar topics: brands, current events, priorities in life. She starts to get suspicious and uses her photography gigs to study locals around the California Republic.
- She eventually catches wind of a rumor that _some major corporations or agencies_ figured out a way to hack into individuals' YFB implants and have been subtly influencing their thoughts for capitalist reasons. This leads her to a small rebel group named **The Wheel**, aimed at trying to stop this so citizens can think freely "like we used to and were always supposed to."
	- "The Wheel" both represents the metaphor of a brain running healthy free of influence, and an obscure reference to the early 2000s movie _Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy_ in which Baxter, the canine companion to the titular character, eats a whole wheel of cheese, which the founders think is funny. 
	- The founder is a man named Armand Taylor, who's a bit in over his head. He does believe the abuse of YFB is wrong, but underestimated how quickly his "rebellion" would escalate into a real underground force.
	- Talia's work starts to take on new meaning, and she begins participating in activities with The Wheel. In order to hide her connection to Aaron, she adopts an alias, Wendy Crimson.
	- After discovering the full extent of the conspiracy, she realizes that Tye might be the only one who can shut it all down and tries to contact him - and fails.
