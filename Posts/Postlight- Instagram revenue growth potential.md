# Postlight: Instagram revenue growth potential
## Summary
Instagram primarily generates revenue via sponsored and branded content disseminated through its platform. Its advertising arm, Instagram For Business, integrates deeply into the Instagram app experience. 

According to [a 2014 Fast Company article][1], Instagram’s advertising platform is quite lucrative for both the company and its brand partners - it generated between $250-400 million in 2014, and its users generated 2x engagement when compared to Facebook. However, the same article illustrates that Instagram is underutilized by brands, indicating that “only 19% of marketers said they will Instagram a high priority in 2015.” 

The [Instagram For Business portal][2] clearly explains the value proposition and types of integrations available to ad partners. However, it can be assumed that there is opportunity to improve both the offering & its interactivity with Instagram’s user base.

In the following, I propose four areas in which Instagram could iterate and launch products toward a goal of **increasing revenue by 20% over the course of a year**. Each of these areas include both larger possible projects and small tests of user behavior. These areas are:
1. Additional curation possibilities within the Explore experience
2. Feed and navigation experiments within the Instagram iOS/Android apps
3. Push notification experiments on Instagram iOS/Android
4. New, reaction-driven content types to generate more valuable insights from viewers
5. Better capitalization upon Instagram’s web app traffic
6. Introduction of a “premium” Instagram service offering for non-brands/advertisers

It can be assumed that Instagram has a large product team that can potentially execute on most or all of these focus areas; however, I have attempted to prioritize them in order of effort, potential return on investment, and proximity to what I believe are Instagram’s core product values.

### 1. Additional curation possibilities in the Explore tab
Instagram reportedly receives 80 million new photos per day, which is far too many for any average user to dig through to find the best photos. The Explore tab provides a huge opportunity to curate amazing content for its users, and the feature also presents an opportunity to provide even better targeting of great photos to its users - and generate additional revenue. However, while [31% of surveyed Instagram users frequently explore photos by people they don’t follow, only about 21% of them use Explore and 19% of these users find the content in Explore within their interests][3]. The presents a big opportunity for improvement in the relevance and quality of content within Explore, and for revenue generation within Explore.

Instagram Explore currently only offers a single component containing curated content - the hero slider. This defaults to “This Week on Instagram,” a curated set of images, and contains a few other topically relevant curated topics. Everything else within the main Explore experience appears to be algorithmically generated (“trending tags” and popular posts seem to be all that’s  available). How does one dig deeply into content that’s truly interesting to the user, and how does that tie back to revenue? Simply put: **offering more diverse and relevant content to the end user will encourage further interaction with this content**, thus increasing lifetime value and interaction with sponsored content.

There are a few ways to begin to tackle this problem. Let’s assume that the Explore tab is powered by a Content Management System that can push server-side updates to the app; this means that Instagram can begin easily testing different curation tactics. Beyond this, there are 3 main areas that could use improvement in the Explore product itself:
1. Exposing other curated sets of content that are not immediately visible in the hero slider, perhaps via a “directory” sub-feature;
2. Experimenting with additional algorithmic hashtag feeds beyond “Trending tags”, such as Popular Near You (leveraging location) and Hidden Gems (content with high likes/comments but less popular hashtags);
3. Experimenting with basic categories of **users** to follow, in addition to posts. Instagram’s curation team could select  brands & users to populate these categories (eg. Socially Conscious Brands, Basketball Greats, Hot R&B Musicians), and the categories could be integrated into the Explore screen.

In each case, presumably, there is a wide variety of sponsored content (or content that can be later monetized) to be surfaced to the larger Instagram community. Instagram can test minimum-viable versions of each of these features and monitor clickthrough trends to understand the most effective types of exploratory tactics, further shaping a powerful discovery strategy for the Explore tab.

### 2. Feed & navigation experiments on iOS & Android
When one opens the Instagram app, the default view is his/her Feed, which contains both posts by whomever the user follows as well as occasional Sponsored posts. Presumably, this is the primary means by which users view and engage with these posts, but the core feature hasn’t changed much at all since its original inception in 2010. A small track of experiments within the core Instagram experience may create meaningful improvements to users’ engagement rate with sponsored content with low effort. Below are two tests to begin this track.

**1. Test higher frequency of Sponsored posts within the feed.** Currently, Instagram displays a sponsored post approximately every 10-15 posts within the feed. Testing higher frequencies of sponsored posts might lead to higher ad impressions, clickthroughs and thus revenue. 

This may adversely affect the customer experience by downplaying the amount of posts from the user’s friends - however, Instagram data may help gauge the possible negative effects here. For example, users who already follow brands on Instagram are less likely to be negatively affected by this change. Perhaps a follow-up test could be to target users who follow many brands differently than users who follow a few or no brands.

**2. Test the Explore tab as the default for users.** While the feed is highly engaging, the Explore tab arguably exposes even more content to the end user through highly curated, popular and categorized Instagram posts. If Instagram made the Explore tab the primary view for its users, users may develop different and higher clickthrough habits and become exposed to even more sponsored & branded content, leading to higher revenue for Instagram.

A simple first A/B test could be to render the Explore tab as the default screen for 50% of iOS users and monitor clickstream data for these users, compared to the remaining 50% control group. Subsequent tests could be run to optimize various other elements of the experience, such as:
- Which users see Explore or the Feed by default
- A deeper introduction to Explore during the new user walkthrough, to encourage more usage of Explore earlier on
- The placement of the two screens within the app navigation

### 3. Experiments with push notifications
Currently, Instagram allows its users basic control over push notifications: for likes and comments from one’s followers or anyone, new follow requests, when one’s friends join Instagram, etc. However, Instagram can leverage carefully-positioned notifications to position interesting brands & other ad clients toward its users.

Because notifications can be executed server-side, Instagram can create experiments around notifications promoting branded content in useful ways for its users. Below are just a few ideas for experiments that can be run:
- A/B test a new notification that notifies a user when 5 of his/her followers follow a given brand user, such as Nike. Enable the notified user to tap toward Nike’s profile immediately, or perhaps offer a one-click follow action.
- A/B test the ability for certain brand clients to force-push a notification to its followers in some cases when the brand creates a new Instagram post. In practice, a brand like Nike can leverage this to announce exciting offers or contests to its follower base. This could allow Nike to increase impressions and clicks from its existing follower base.
- A/B test a notification that informs a user of popular or sponsored posts that he/she may have missed in the past week (similar to [Twitter’s “While You Were Away”][4] feature). Presumably, Instagram can track when a given user viewed or tapped on a post in his/her feed, and can use this to create a set of posts the user has *not* seen. If successful, this notification scheme can be further developed into a full-fledged feature for users and brands.

In each case, one can monitor read and clickthrough rate on the notification scheme itself. Perhaps in a follow-up exercise, Instagram can allow users to enable/disable these new notifications schemes (enabled by default); a further test could monitor how many users proactively disable these notifications schemes.

### 4. New, reaction-driven content types for brands
Currently, Instagram offers photos, videos and multi-image sliders (each of which may contain clickthrough actions, such as a link to redeem a coupon) as content types to its brand partners. However, various other content-driven networks have experimented with other media types with success - for example, Twitter’s new Polls feature has [helped drive a meaningful increase in conversations][5] around a given poll’s topic than standard Tweets. Buzzfeed has also successfully experimented with “reactions” widgets within their content pages, both in terms of [increasing user engagement][6] and [better categorizing their content][7]. 

The meaningful takeaway here is this: if a user can create content with the ability for other users to react directly and intentionally, the users will establish a deeper connection with the brand and its content footprint. A reaction should require less overhead than an original comment but more investment than a “heart.” Instagram can experiment with other content types in this vein to allow brands to both *drive increased clickthroughs* and *gain more valuable insights* from their Instagram followers.

Three possible approaches, all of which have been successfully employed by other content-driven businesses, are:
- Experimenting additional reactions to Instagram posts, in addition to the “heart.” These could be confined to small set of Emojis corresponding to particular emotions at first, and receive further iterations over time.
- Creating a “poll” (or “hot or not”) content type, which would allow a brand to combine two photos into a single post and grant the viewer the ability to tap on either. This would “cast a vote” for one of the two photos and increment a simple counter on the back-end. The brand could receive insights from the counters to learn the opinions of its users, similar to the aforementioned Twitter approach.
- Allowing businesses to create posts that self-destruct after a given time period elapses from initial view. The viewer may be incentivized to act upon the business’ Instagram post to receive an offer or discount in a limited time. This could meaningfully incentivize casual followers of the business to interact with more of its content.

If any of these content types are successful in driving more meaningful engagement (clickthrough rate, likes and impressions) with brands’ content, they may be rolled out to the larger Instagram community for use afterward.

### 5. Missed opportunities on the web
According to compete.com, Instagram.com (the minimal web app that Instagram launched in 2012) has been increasing in traffic over the past year - it received 55 million unique visitors this October, and has sustained this traffic through November. Yet the web interface has no trace of the sponsored content - leading to a pleasant, minimalist UI with plenty of room to grow. 

It's safe to assume that a majority of Instagram's web traffic is coming from referrals to specific photo pages, rather than Instagram.com itself - users naturally are sharing their Instagram photos on various other social networks, and clickthroughs are routing users to those specific photo detail pages. However, there is potentially an opportunity to drive users from these pages deeper into the Instagram for Web experience, in which sponsored posts could be surfaced. 

First, one can run experiments on Instagram.com pages to test clickthrough methods. Let's assume that clickthrough rate from an Instagram photo post to another page on Instagram.com page is 0.5%. Several tests could be run to drive an increase in clickthroughs, such as:
- Adding a clear link to the user’s Instagram feed in the top navigation
- Adding various useful links to the site’s top navigation (Explore, Following, Followers, etc.)
- On the photo detail page, displaying “related” photos or additional photos by the given user

The above experiments will likely increase the amount of traffic to Instagram.com, the feed, such that including sponsored content within the website may prove lucrative for generating revenue.

### 6. One last monetization thought: Instagram Premium
There are some Instagram users who will not respond to sponsored content, regardless of its relevance or quality. It could be worthwhile to explore the possibility of a “premium” Instagram experience, in which a user pays a recurring membership fee in exchange for an ad-free experience as well as other useful premium features.

Instagram could determine the demand and value of this premium membership concept by surveying segments of its users, such as:
- its most active non-business users
- its users who most frequently open the app but never view the Explore tab
- its users who post frequently but rarely browse the app
- its users who interact primarily via notifications

Obviously, offering users the ability to *bypass sponsored content* for a premium puts brands at a disadvantage, shrinking the size of their potential impressionable market. However, depending on the apparent demand of an ad-free experience and the potential success of other initiatives to grow impressions and clickthrough rate for sponsored content, this could be explored later.
