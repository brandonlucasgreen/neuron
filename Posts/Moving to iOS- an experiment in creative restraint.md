# Moving to iOS: an experiment in creative restraint
On Monday I'm receiving a company laptop. I have mixed feelings about this - it inevitably and subliminally will have me working more on trains and on weekends, but I'll be able to do so much faster than I currently do via Microsoft Remote Desktop.

Why do I bring this up? I bring this up because I have a beautiful, expensive Retina MacBook Pro that I've been using for the bulk of all my work for almost 3 years. It's my indispensable sidekick for recording music, writing, (attempts at) coding, managing my finances, pretty much everything. Since starting my current job, though, I've started to spend less and less time with it - occasionally pulling it out on crowded trains, opportunistically pushing it to its limits by recording for hours at a time on weekends, painstakingly RDP-ing into my work machine just to run a few SQL queries. Sometimes it sits on a desk for days at a time, neglected. 

Now that I'm getting this other laptop, I have even less use for the thing. 

I have an iPad Air 2 - this thing is also generally neglected in my household. [Alicia][1] will occasionally use it to watch TV in bed, and I'll occasionally check Twitter or read some blogs with it, but that's about it. I had downloaded Ulysses for iOS a few months back thinking I could use this iPad as a blogging machine, but even that felt redundant with the MacBook Pro. 

I realized, however, that the work laptop has given me an opportunity to change the way I work outside of my day job a bit. After reading about the amazing power in the new iPads and the app potential brought by iOS 9, I've decided to run some day-to-day experiments using the iPad Air 2 in attempting to make it my primary computer.

**There's already been a ton of writing on this** - I'm really happy to have dug into the writings on iPad on [MacStories][2], [Daring Fireball][3], the [Music App Blog][4] and other sites, so I have plenty of foundational ideas to work with. I'm interested in seeing how I can leverage my iPad for my personal use cases: 
- rapid blogging in [Ulysses][5],
- music recording in [Auria Pro][6] with a plethora of synth/sampler/effects apps wired together via [Audiobus][7],
- pseudo-local website development with [Working Copy][8], [Coda][9] and [Transmit][10],
- managing my music, technical and personal projects with [Trello][11] and various stock iOS apps

...and I'm sure many more along the way. I'm mainly interested in testing just how portable my tech can be and moving to a single operating system (that is, iOS), but I'm also curious as to what new possibilities there are brought by the iOS framework and app ecosystem.

More to come. I should probably start getting used to this tiny keyboard...
